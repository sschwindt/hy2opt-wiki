The commercial *Tuflow* code performs 2D hydrodynamic simulations either with an [implicit ("Classic")](http://tuflow.com/Solvers.aspx) or an [explicit HPC (Heavily Parallelised Compute)](http://tuflow.com/Solvers.aspx?TUFLOWHPC) solver. The HPC solver features CPU and highly efficient GPU compatibility. A [demo license](https://wiki.tuflow.com/index.php?title=New_User_Guide_Free_Demo_Version)  with limited capacities is available to test and train users on *Tuflow*.
*Hy2Opt*'s *Tuflow* tab provides routines to create, optimize and run [*Tuflow*](http://tuflow.com/) models.

## Usage

1. Prepare geospatial data ([instructions](#pgd))
1. Prepare boundary conditions ([instructions](#pbc))
1. Launch the [Model Setup Wizard](#msw) to create a model
1. Run the *Tuflow* model pre-processor for model optimization (OPTIONAL)
1. Select model and run *Tuflow*


## Requirements

A *Tuflow* model needs at least the following:

1. A licensed (demo/full) [installation of *Tuflow*](http://tuflow.com/Downloads.aspx);
1. GIS software (e.g., [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/));
1. Workbook editor (e.g., [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/));
1. A topography (DEM) raster;
1. Knowledge about the riverbed substrate (at best: a grain size raster); and
1. A stage-discharge (h-Q) relationship at the downstream model end.

We strongly recommend to validate the results of the *Tuflow* model, for instance with in-situ measurements of flow depth and velocity (read more for example in [Barker *et al.* 2018][barker18]).

## Get Started<a name="start"></a>

*Hy2Opt*'s tabs invites to create or to select a model. A model can be created by selecting the [*"Model Setup Wizard"*](#msw).

![tfgui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sschwindt/hy2opt-wiki/master/assets/images/tuflow_start.png)

The [*Model Setup Wizard*](#msw) guides in X steps through the creation of a template for generating  a *Tuflow*  model. Before starting the wizard, a couple of input files need to be prepared, which require individual decisions. *Hy2Opt* provides templates and examples in the *templates4users/Tuflow* folder, which may be used in the file preparation described in the sections below.

## Preparation

***

### Prepare geodata<a name="pgd"></a>

The model creation wizard will inquire the location of geospatial data files that should be prepared before starting the wizard. **Make sure to use the same coordinate system, projection, and units consistently in all geospatial data files.**
Recommendation: Prepare all geospatial files in an external folder with the same name as the model.

The following GRID (raster datasets) files will be required:

- Topography (DEM) raster in [`ASC`](https://wiki.tuflow.com/index.php?title=QGIS_Export_Raster_to_asc) or `FLT` formats

The following (vector) shapefiles (`.SHP`) are required ([read drawing instructions](https://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/training_manual/create_vector_data/create_new_vector.html) and see figure below) and templates can be found in ***templates4users/Tuflow/***.

![shp_illu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sschwindt/hy2opt-wiki/master/assets/images/illustrate_shapefiles.png)

- `2d_code_NAME_R.shp`: A **polygon** shapefile that indicates the initial expected wetted area (within one or more polygons). Add a `Code` field and draw active (wetted) polygons that may be oriented at aerial imagery. Assign the active polygon(s)  a `Code`-value of 1.
- `2d_loc_NAME_L.shp`: A poly**line** shapefile defining the location where Tuflow will create the model boundary. Draw a line from downstream to upstream (against flow) direction. No modification of the *Attribute Table* is required.
- `2d_bc_NAME_HT_L.shp`: A poly**line** shapefile  defining the downstream flow exit line (`L`) that will be defined with a water surface elevation (`H`) over time (`T`). The outflow line should include the expected left and right banks, and may include dry zones, too (better too long than too short). Define 3 text-fields called `Type`, `Flags`, and `Name`; define 5 double-numeric-fields called `f`, `d`, `td`, `a`, and `b`. The `Name` textfield requires the name of the outlet (the other text-fields may be left empty). The numeric-fields can all be set to 0.
- `2d_sa_NAME_QT_R.shp`: A **polygon** shapefile defining the *Source Area* (`sa`) in terms of a polygon that delineates the upstream inflow region (`R`), where a discharge (`Q`) will be defined over time (`T`). Use a polygon rather than a line to enable the GPU solver (cannot run with a line). Define a text-field named `Name` to assign every polygon a (source area) name. The here defined source area polygon's names will be used in the [definition of inflow boundary conditions](#pbc).
- `2d_po_NAME_L.shp`: A poly**line** shapefile containg monitoring cross section lines for tracking discharge (or any other [data type](#modt)) through time within the model domain. Define three text-fields named `Type`, `Label`, and `Comment`. The `Type` field marks the variable to output (e.g., `Q_` for discharge). The `Label` will be used in output tables to label the output data (**must be defined**). `Q_`-type lines close the upstream and downstream boundary will provide model consistency evaluations (i.e., indicate at what simulation time the model converges). However, the more lines are drawn here, the slower will be the calculation. Note that the sense of line orientation will affect the sign of output variables (negative or positive).
- `2d_po_NAME_P.shp`: A **point** shapefile containg monitoring points where velocity (or any other [data type](#modt)) can be tracked through time within the model domain. Define three text-fields named `Type`, `Label`, and `Comment`. The `Type` field marks the variable to output (e.g., `V_` for velocity). The `Label` will be used in output tables to label the output data (**must be defined**). `V_`-type points close the upstream and downstream boundary will provide model consistency evaluations (i.e., indicate at what simulation time the model converges). As for the po-line file, limit the number of points to avoid slowing down the calculation.
- `2d_mat_NAME_R.shp`: A **polygon** shapefile defining materials that characterize, for example, terrain roughness. The shapefile must have a field named `Materials` (long-numeric type), where polygons get assigned materials defined in a `csv` table. This `csv` file defines the channel roughness (as a function of [Manning's *n*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_formula#Manning_coefficient_of_roughness)), soil infiltration (see Section 6.10 of the [*Tuflow* manual][tfman]), and land use hazard (see Section 6.9 of the [*Tuflow* manual][tfman]) in the following table shape:

<a name="mat"></a>

| Material ID | Manning's n | Infiltration Parameters | Land Use Hazard ID | ! Description                  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1           | 0.04        |                         |                    | ! Main channel                 |
| 2           | 0.02        |                         |                    | ! Banks                        |
| ...         | ...         |                         |                    | ! Comments describing material |

The materials `csv` file can be created later on with *Hy2Opt*'s [Model Setup Wizard](#msw). Note: Following the recommendations in the [*Tuflow* manual][tfman](sec. 6.9.3), *Hy2Opt* uses the `csv` format rather than the `tmf` format for defining materials. Alternatively, *Tuflow* provides workbook utilities (macros) on their [website](https://www.tuflow.com/Tuflow%20Utilities.aspx) ([direct download link](https://www.tuflow.com/Download/Miscellaneous/Excel_Macros.zip)).


### Prepare boundaries<a name="pbc"></a>

The model must not only know where the water comes from (see polygon names defined in [`2d_sa_NAME_QT_R.shp`](#pgd)), but also when and how much water flows. In addition, a boundary condition is necessary, which can be specified here using a stage-discharge (h-Q) relationship. Follow the steps below to define boundary conditions.

1. Rename the file `Hy2Opt/templates4users/bc_data_EVENT.csv` by changing *EVENT* to a flow event. For example, `bc_data_37.csv` for defining a 37-m³/s (or cfs) discharge event; or `bc_data_HQ10.csv` for defining a ten-year event.

2. Open the renamed `bc_data_EVENT.csv` file in a [spreadsheet editor][libreoffice] and:
   
   - Add at least 3 `Time` rows (e.g., 0.0, 1.0, and 1000.0)
   - For every polygon name defined in [`2d_sa_NAME_QT_R.shp`](#pgd), add one inflow (=source) (or outflow=sink) column. All polygons in [`2d_sa_NAME_QT_R.shp`](#pgd) must be listed here. At least one polygon must be defined. For example, if only one inflow polygon was defined, only rename the `INFLOW1` column (delete the `...` column).
   - Set a flow value for every `INFLOW` column in m³/s (or cfs) for every time row defined in the `Time` column (`float` or `int` value per cell). Note:
     + A negative value denotes a sink (outflow).
     + A steady-discharge simulation corresponds to defining the same discharge within one column for all `Time` rows.
   - Define a downstream stage (i.e., water surface elevation in absolute height such as meters above sea level) at the flow exit line(s) define in the `Name` text-field in `2d_bc_NAME_HT_L.shp`. 
   - Save and close `bc_data_EVENT.csv`.

3. OPTIONAL: To define more events, copy the `bc_data_EVENT.csv` file and repeat the last step.

4. Rename the file `Hy2Opt/user_templates/MODEL_bc_data.csv` according to the *MODEL* to create (e.g., `Hy2Opt/user_examples/Example_bc_data.csv`).

5. Open the renamed `MODEL_bc_data.csv` file in a [spreadsheet editor][libreoffice] and:
   
   - `Name` column (`A`): Copy all column names except "Time" from the just created, renamed `bc_data_EVENT.csv` and paste them transposed as row names starting in cell A2 in the renamed `MODEL_bc_data.csv`.
   - `Source` column (`B`): copy (pull down) `bc_data___event__.csv` to all rows defined in column `A`.
   - `Column 1` column (`C`): copy (pull down) `Time` to all rows defined in column `A`.
   - `Column 2` column (`D`): copy all elements defined in column `A` (except the column header; i.e., do not change the string `Column 2`).
   - Save and close `MODEL_bc_data.csv`.

## Model Setup Wizard<a name="msw"></a>

***

The first tab invites for defining a model name and model control parameters. Note: **This is the only place where model names can be defined.**

![tfmsw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sschwindt/hy2opt-wiki/master/assets/images/msw.png)

### Model control parameters<a name="mcp"></a>

The first step inquires input for model controls, which will be written to *runs/init/`MODEL_NAME.tcf`*. It asks for the following MODEL CONTROL parameters, where drop-down menus provide valid *Tuflow* options (where applicable):

| Parameter                    | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| <sup>\*</sup>`Hardware`      | If your computer has a **powerfull** GPU, this can increase the computing speed many times over. Otherwise (non or non-powerfull GPU), select `CPU`.|
| `License`                    | *Tuflow* provides different licensing options that enable or restrict the modelling performance. ***Hy2Opt* enables the definition of subsequent parameters as a function of the select license.**  |
| `Model Precision`              | Recommended: `Single`. `Double` precision slows down the calculation on GPUs and should only be used for the `Classic` scheme with elevations of more than 100-1000m or with direct rainfall models (mass errors may otherwise occur here). *Hy2Opt* defines model precision via definition of the relevant *Tuflow* executable in the batchfile.|
| <sup>\*</sup>`Solution Scheme` | The `Classic` scheme is a (relatively) slow implicit solver that runs on one single core. The `HPC` scheme uses multiple CPUs (or GPU hardware) with an explicit solver for high speed calculation.|
| `Units`                        | Select a unit system (must comply with the units of the later on required topography / DEM raster). |
### Model stability parameters<a name="msp"></a>

Define the following STABILITY PARAMETERS:

| Parameter                     | Description  |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| `Cell Size`                   | Min. the resolution of the input DEM raster. Coarse resolution results in higher calculation speed an less accuracy. The default is 1.0m.  |
| `Cell Wet/Dry Depth`           | Default: 0.002m. Define according to estimated flood magnitude depth. Should be smaller for direct rainfall approaches (shallow sheet flow).  |
| `Initial water level (Set IWL)`    | Default: `"AUTO"`. Should correspond to the target initial flow water level at the model outlet (downstream). *Hy2Opt* will override this value with a GIS file when model optimization is performed.    |
| `Timestep`                     | The timestep (in seconds) depends on the cell size and should be max. 1/2 to 1/5 of the cell size in meters. The timestep must be small enough to satisfy the [Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition][cfl] for numerical stability. The `HPC` solutions scheme uses adaptive timesteps and the here defined value only repreents the initital condition. *Hy2Opt* comes with a calculator (`Estimate` button) for estimating the adequate timestep.                                             |
| `Viscosity Formulation`        | Preferably use `SMAGORINSKY`. Use `CONSTANT` only when the cell size is much larger than the (expected) flow depth or when other turbulence sources govern (e.g., bed roughness).  |
| `Smagorinsky Viscosity Coefficient`       | The dimensionless [*Smagorinsky* coefficient][smag] *C<sub>s</sub>* has a default value of 0.5. Lower values tend to increase stability, higher values increase calculation speed. If `Viscosity Formulation`==`CONSTANT` is used, *Hy2Opt* ignores this field. |
| `Constant Viscosity Coefficient`       | The constant coefficient *C<sub>c</sub>* has a default value of 0.05 m²/s (US costomary: use 0.5382 ft²/s). Lower values tend to increase stability, higher values increase calculation speed.  If `Viscosity Formulation`==`CONSTANT` is used, *Hy2Opt* automatically uses the `Constant Viscosity Coefficient` only, where the recommended value is 1.0 m²/s (reasonable range: 0.2 m²/s to 1.0 m²/s). |


<sup>\*</sup>`PARAMETER`s marked with an asterisk are only available with a full *Tuflow* license.

### Model output parameters<a name="mop"></a>

The next step inquires output parameters:

| Parameter               | Description     |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `Map Output Format`     | Multiple selection of map output formats is possible. |
| `Map Output Data Types` | Select a map output format and define output data types. Multiple selection of map output data types is possible. [See definitions of Map Output Data Types](#modt). |
| `Map Output Interval`   | Default: 360 seconds. Enter an integer number to replace the default value. |

**SAVE THE MODEL**.

## Geometry<a name="geo"></a>
***
The next step inquires geometry and geographic parameters, as well as geofiles, which will be written to the *model/`MODEL_NAME.tgc`* files. Provide the following geospatial file definitions according to the before prepared files ([see above descriptions](#pgd)).

| Parameter  | Target  | Description  |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| `Read GIS Location` | `model\grid\2d_loc_MODEL_L.shp`      | *Shapefile (`shp`)* defining the location where *Tuflow* creates the boundary. |
| `Grid Size`         | `X, Y`   | Dimensions of the grid (`X`-rows and `Y`-columns in m or ft); must not be an exact multiple of `Cell Size`. *Hy2Opt* provides a built-in function for calculating the grid size from the extents of the `Read GIS Location` layer. The internal storage variable has the shape `tuple(X, Y)`. |
| `Set Zpts`          | `3000` (`Int` in m or ft) | Default definition of *Zpts* (Section 6.2 in the [*Tuflow* manual][tfman]). The relevant points are overwritten with the next parameter (`Read GRID Zpts`). A high value ensures that gaps in the `asc` or `flt` DEM raster can easily be identified. |
| `Read GRID Zpts`    | `model\grid\asc` or `flt` DEM raster | The preferred method to define Z-point elevations in *Hy2Opt* (alternatives: `Read GRID <option>` as defined in the [*Tuflow* manual][tfman] in Appendix C). |
| `Set Code`          | `0` (`Int` as Boolean)               | Defines that the DEM is trimmed to the model boundary. Note: `Set Code` must be defined after `Read GRID Zpts`.  If you are unsure what value to use, keep the default (`0`).|
| `Read GIS Code`     | `model\gis\2d_code_MODEL_R.shp`      | Select a polygon shapefile that indicates the initial expected wetted area within a polygon. Active (wetted) polygons must have a code-value=1 and may be oriented at aerial imagery.  |
| `Set Mat`           | `1` (`Int` of default material)      | Define the default material ID for all cells that are not defined in the materials polygon (see `Read GIS Mat`).   |
| `Read GIS Mat`      | `model\gis\2d_mat_MODEL_R.shp`       | Polygon shapefile defining material IDs. Parameter can be ignored for using the default material (see `Set Mat`) everywhere.   |

The following geometry parameters will be written to the *model/`MODEL_NAME.tbc`* file. 

| Parameter | Default  | Description  |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `Read GIS BC` | `model\gis\2d_bc_MODEL_HT_L.shp` | *Shapefile (`shp`)* defining the downstream flow exit line (`L`) that will be defined with a water surface elevation (`H`) over time (`T`).     |
| `Read GIS SA` | `model\gis\2d_sa_MODEL_QT_R.shp` | *Shapefile (`shp`)* defining the *Source Area* (`sa`) in terms of a polygon that delineates the upstream inflow region (`R`), where a discharge (`Q`) will be defined over time (`T`). Use a polygon rather than a line to enable the GPU solver (cannot run with a line). |

Note that *Hy2Opt* writes the `Cell Size` parameter in the [`.tcf`](#mcp) file.

| BSS  | Bed Shear Stress             | All formats excluding WaterRIDE | Bed Shear Stress as given by the equation below where ρ is density, g gravity, V velocity, n Manning’s n and y depth. The Bed Shear Stress map output can be misleading at very shallow depths as the BSS formula divides by the depth.  The BSS and SP outputs are linearly reduced to zero once the depth is below a threshold (by default, 0.1m).  This threshold can be changed using the .tcf command BSS Cutoff Depth.   Tracking of maximum BSS was enabled in  version 2016-03-AB of TUFLOW Classic and 2017-09-AC of TUFLOW HPC.Prior to the 2017 release BSS output in English Units were in Poundals per square foot (pdl/ft2). From the 2017 release onwards the units will be Pounds Force per square foot (lbf/ft2), therefore the BSS values are 32.174 times smaller than for releases prior to 2017.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| d    | Depth                        | All formats excluding WaterRIDE | Water depths.  For the cell cornered results formats (see Section 9.6.7.3) the depths are calculated as the interpolated water level at the nodes (see _h.dat below) less the ZH value.  The interpolated water level may occasionally lie below the ZH value, in which case a negative depth may result which is set to zero by default (see Zero Negative Depths).  Both maximum and minimum output is available. For maximum depth output this is calculated at the end of the simulation based on the maximum water level and the ground elevation.  For models that utilise varying ground elevations (using the Read GIS Variable Z Shape or variable geometry (VG)  boundaries), care should be taken when interpreting maximum depth outputs.  Hazard outputs (based on velocity and depth) are tracked at each timestep, and the maximum for these is the maximum at any timestep during the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| E    | Energy                       | All formats excluding WaterRIDE | Scalar data file containing the energy levels at the element nodes (cell corners).  The energy levels are based on the interpolated water levels calculated at the cell centres plus the dynamic head (V2/2g).  Due to the interpolation, occasionally an “increase” in energy can occur - an alternative approach to correctly display energy without interpolation is being trialled using the HIGH RES options (see Map Output Format). For 1D areas, this output should be treated with caution as it is derived from interpolation of water levels and approximations of the channel velocities across the WLLs, which can be problematic in 1D channels with high velocities.  The energy output for 1D nodes is available as part of the plotting output (Section 13.2).

Note:  The maximum unit flow is not tracked for the q output, the Z0 hazard value option can be used, as this output is tracked at each timestep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| R    | Flow Regime                  | All formats excluding WaterRIDE | Flow regime.  The output value is 0 (zero) for normal (sub-critical flow with momentum); greater than 1 for upstream controlled friction flow (e.g. supercritical flow); ‑1.5 for broad-crested weir flow; and ‑1 for flow through a flow constriction when the deck is submerged.  No maximum and minimum output is available at this stage. When using the default cell corner approach, the flow regime is a weighted average of the flow regimes at the four adjoining cell mid-sides, which can therefore be misleading.  Using the Map Output Format == SMS HIGH RES option will output the exact flow regime occurring at the cell mid-sides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| SP   | Stream Power                 | All formats excluding WaterRIDE | Stream Power as given by the equation below where τbed is bed shear stress (see BSS above) and V is velocity.The Stream Power map output can be misleading at very shallow depths as the BSS formula divides by the depth.  The BSS and SP outputs are linearly reduced to zero once the depth is below a threshold (by default, 0.1m).  This threshold can be changed using the .tcf command BSS Cutoff Depth.  Tracking of maximum SP was enabled in  version 2016-03-AB of TUFLOW Classic and 2018-03-AB of HPC. Prior to the 2017 release SP output in English Units were in Poundals per square foot (pdl/ft2). From the 2017 release onwards the units will be Pounds Force per square foot (lbf/ft2), therefore the SP values are 32.174 times smaller than for releases prior to 2017.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| V    | Vector Velocity              | All formats                     | Flow velocity.  The resulting velocity vector is calculated from the surrounding u and v-points. Note:  The maximum and minimum velocities are tracked over time.  By default the maximum velocities are tracked over 0.1m depth, below this depth the velocity at maximum water level is used.  See the Maximum Velocity Cutoff Depth command for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ZH   | Bathymetry                   | All formats excluding WaterRIDE | Elevations at the cell corners (ZH points).  This information is already contained in the .2dm file, however, this option is useful if the model’s bathymetry varies over time because of variable geometry (2d_vzsh or VG boundaries) or for morphological modelling.  This output is very useful if you are comparing two or more runs that have different topography (e.g. before and after scenarios), and you wish to easily view or compare the topography for each scenario within SMS or post-process using TUFLOW_to_GIS (refer to Section 15.2.1). If the topography in the model does not change over time (i.e. no variable Z shapes or morphological changes), for the default .xmdf output format the ZH Zpt values are output once, rather than every timestep, thereby not consuming disk space unnecessarily.   The ZH map output will appear under a XMDF folder “Fixed”.   This feature is only available if using the XMDF format, for other output formats, the bathymetry will be output at each output interval. For builds 2016-03-AC onwards, this output is available for TUFLOW GPU.  Builds prior to 2016-03-AC had this output disabled for GPU simulations. No maximum and minimum output is available at this stage. |
